/*
 ** A complete page cache is an instance of this structure.  Every
 ** entry in the cache holds a single page of the database file.  The
 ** btree layer only operates on the cached copy of the database pages.
 **
 ** A page cache entry is "clean" if it exactly matches what is currently
 ** on disk.  A page is "dirty" if it has been modified and needs to be
 ** persisted to disk.
 **
 ** pDirty, pDirtyTail, pSynced:
 **   All dirty pages are linked into the doubly linked list using
 **   PgHdr.pDirtyNext and pDirtyPrev. The list is maintained in LRU order
 **   such that p was added to the list more recently than p->pDirtyNext.
 **   PCache.pDirty points to the first (newest) element in the list and
 **   pDirtyTail to the last (oldest).
 **
 **   The PCache.pSynced variable is used to optimize searching for a dirty
 **   page to eject from the cache mid-transaction. It is better to eject
 **   a page that does not require a journal sync than one that does.
 **   Therefore, pSynced is maintained to that it *almost* always points
 **   to either the oldest page in the pDirty/pDirtyTail list that has a
 **   clear PGHDR_NEED_SYNC flag or to a page that is older than this one
 **   (so that the right page to eject can be found by following pDirtyPrev
 **   pointers).
