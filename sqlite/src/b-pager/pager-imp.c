/*
 ** This function is called by the pcache layer when it has reached some
 ** soft memory limit. The first argument is a pointer to a Pager object
 ** (cast as a void*). The pager is always 'purgeable' (not an in-memory
 ** database). The second argument is a reference to a page that is
 ** currently dirty but has no outstanding references.
 ** The page is always associated with the Pager object passed as the first argument.
 **
 ** The job of this function is to make pPg clean by writing its contents
 ** out to the database file, if possible. This may involve syncing the
 ** journal file.
 **
 ** If successful, sqlite3PcacheMakeClean() is called on the page and
 ** SQLITE_OK returned. If an IO error occurs while trying to make the
 ** page clean, the IO error code is returned. If the page cannot be
 ** made clean for some other reason, but no error occurs, then SQLITE_OK
 ** is returned by sqlite3PcacheMakeClean() is not called.

/*
 ** The argument is the first in a linked list of dirty pages connected
 ** by the PgHdr.pDirty pointer. This function writes each one of the
 ** in-memory pages in the list to the database file. The argument may
 ** be NULL, representing an empty list. In this case this function is
 ** a no-op.
 **
 ** The pager must hold at least a RESERVED lock when this function
 ** is called. Before writing anything to the database file, this lock
 ** is upgraded to an EXCLUSIVE lock. If the lock cannot be obtained,
 ** SQLITE_BUSY is returned and no data is written to the database file.
 **
 ** If the pager is a temp-file pager and the actual file-system file
 ** is not yet open, it is created and opened before any data is
 ** written out.
 **
 ** Once the lock has been upgraded and, if necessary, the file opened,
 ** the pages are written out to the database file in list order. Writing
 ** a page is skipped if it meets either of the following criteria:
 **
 **   * The page number is greater than Pager.dbSize, or
 **   * The PGHDR_DONT_WRITE flag is set on the page.
 **
 ** If writing out a page causes the database file to grow, Pager.dbFileSize
 ** is updated accordingly. If page 1 is written out, then the value cached
 ** in Pager.dbFileVers[] is updated to match the new value stored in
 ** the database file.
 **
 ** If everything is successful, SQLITE_OK is returned. If an IO error
 ** occurs, an IO error code is returned. Or, if the EXCLUSIVE lock cannot
 ** be obtained, SQLITE_BUSY is returned.
